# NodeMCU Relay Control with Blynk

This project demonstrates how to control four relays using a NodeMCU (ESP8266) board and the Blynk platform. Relay 1 is controlled both via the Blynk app and a scheduled time-based system, while the other relays are controlled via the Blynk app only.

## Components

- NodeMCU (ESP8266)
- 4-Channel Relay Module
- Wi-Fi Network
- Blynk App

## Requirements
